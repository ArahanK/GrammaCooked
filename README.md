# Gramma Cooked
Do you long for the warm embrace of nostalgia, the comforting aroma of grandma's kitchen, and the taste of home-cooked meals that transport you back in time? Look no further, as Gramma Cooked is here to bring those cherished moments to your table!

## Inspiration
In a fast-paced world where people often find themselves living alone, the desire for the familiar taste of home-cooked meals is a universal yearning. Gramma Cooked was born out of the idea that everyone should have access to the joy and comfort that comes from enjoying a dish prepared with love and tradition (or just a better alternative to magically making your grandma spawn into your home some days).

## What it does
Gramma Cooked is not just a chatbot; it's a culinary companion that connects you with the essence of nostalgia. By simply uploading an image of your messy fridge or tabletop, Gramma Cooked identifies the available ingredients, compiles a list, and lets you customize it based on your preferences. It then suggests a curated selection of vintage recipes tailored to your cultural and locational preference at that moment! Craving some spicy Mediterranean? Gramma got you. Want to connect with your South Indian roots? Gramma got you. Craving a nice Italian touch for your date? Gramma got you.

## How we built it
Our team delved into uncharted territories, combining image recognition, natural language processing, and a vast database of timeless recipes. The result is a seamless and user-friendly chatbot that captures the essence of grandma's cooking. 

## Challenges we ran into
Embarking on this culinary journey posed its challenges, from fine-tuning image recognition algorithms to testing a diverse and authentic recipe database. However, our determination to bring the taste of nostalgia prevailed, and we overcame each obstacle with creativity and perseverance. We had never worked extensively with chatbots and frontend before. It was a huge learning experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take immense pride in creating Gramma Cooked, a platform that not only identifies ingredients but also understands the emotional connection people have with their food. Our accomplishment lies in providing a solution that goes beyond a mere list of recipes; it fosters a sense of belonging, warmth, and genuine connection to one's roots.

## What we learned
This hackathon has been a journey of self-discovery and exploration. We delved into the intricacies of image recognition, cultural nuances, and the profound impact that food has on our emotions and memories. Gramma Cooked taught us that innovation can be deeply rooted in tradition. Learning Flask for the first time, and trying out combining APIs with minimal knowledge of coding was the most challenging part. I'm sure the mentors now know us by the name (the amount of times they've been summoned).

## What's next for Gramma Cooked
The journey doesn't end here. Gramma Cooked is poised to evolve into a comprehensive platform, expanding its recipe repertoire, embracing more cultural diversity, and incorporating advanced features such as personalized cooking tips and video tutorials. The love and passion that fueled this project will continue to drive us forward, bringing the taste of nostalgia to tables around the world.

Join us in celebrating the magic of Gramma Cooked - where technology meets tradition, and every dish tells a story of love, warmth, and cherished memories.
